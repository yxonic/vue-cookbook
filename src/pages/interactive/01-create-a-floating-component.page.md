# Create a floating component

You want to show a menu or tooltip, after user clicks / hovers a button.

Floating components doesn't disrupt the flow of the main content. Therefore, we actually don't have to make any modification to the main content. The biggest concerns of building a floating component are about the floating element:
1. We should decide the position of the floating element relative to the reference element.
2. We want to control when and how it appears / disappears.
