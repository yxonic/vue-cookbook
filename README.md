# Vue Cookbook

Modern web has become a mixture of technology, design, engineering, marketing, management, and the list goes on. A seemingly simple web page may require a huge amount of work with all these concerns being considered.

However, web technology is evolving equally fast. After reaching version 3.0 in 2020, the Vue stack has achieved a pretty nice balance of all these concerns, especially combined with the expressive power of utility-first CSS frameworks like TailwindCSS and WindiCSS. We can focus more on ideas we want to express, instead of striving just to make things work. That's why I started writing this cookbook: to share my thoughts on how to express ideas with Vue, and how to do so more clearly and effectively.

Though this cookbook is written in Vue, the ideas about UI, design, engineering, and so on, apply to other frameworks as well. Therefore, in this cookbook, I won't go through any technology details. Each recipe tries to be clear about what we want to achieve, and gives a big picture on how to achieve it, but not explaining the process step-by-step. I hope it will help more general audience to rethink about web design and development.
