After reaching version 3.0 in 2020, the Vue stack has achieved a pretty nice balance of all these concerns, especially combined with the expressive power of utility-first CSS frameworks like TailwindCSS and WindiCSS. We can focus more on ideas we want to express, instead of striving just to make things work. That\u2019s why I started writing this cookbook: to share my thoughts on how to express ideas with Vue, and how to do so more clearly and effectively."]),e("p",{},["Though this cookbook is written in Vue, the ideas about UI, design, engineering, and so on, apply to other frameworks as well.
